# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts (OOPs) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design based on objects, which act as representations of real-world entities. It emphasizes the creation of reusable code by encapsulating both data and behavior within these objects, making it easier to manage and develop complex applications.

**Objects:** Instances of classes that contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

**Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors. A class encapsulates data and provides methods to manipulate that data.

**Encapsulation:** The practice of bundling data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some components. This helps protect an object's integrity by exposing only what is necessary.

**Inheritance:** A mechanism that allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Polymorphism:** The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. This includes method overloading (using the same method name with 
different parameters) and method overriding (a subclass redefining a method from its parent class).

**Abstraction:** The concept of hiding complex implementation details while exposing only the essential features of an object. This can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
